# Hide-and-show-items-in-a-mac-desktop
Two apps that can hide and show all items and folders in your mac desktop.

You probably noticed the Harry Potter reference, and it works exactly the same : 
   -> add those two scripts in your mac dock
   -> then click on the Lumos button, all your Desktop icons disappear, and 
   -> reappear when clicking the Nox button
